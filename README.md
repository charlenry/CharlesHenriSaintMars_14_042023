# The project HRnet (14)

The technology department of a large financial company, `Wealth Health` uses an internal web application, called `HRnet` , that manages employee records. The application is old and uses `jQuery plugins` on the front end. I need to do a redesign of the frontend with React without the jQuery plugins. Then I need to compare the performance of the old version with the new one using `Lighthouse`. Finally, I have to publish on npm one of the Jquery plugins converted to React.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
